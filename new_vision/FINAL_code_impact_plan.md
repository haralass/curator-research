## Section 1: Codebase Inventory

### Python files

| File | What it currently does | Maps to in new system | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| `app.py` | FastAPI app with 30+ endpoints: ingest, proposals, pipeline, clusters, search, duplicates, inbox, UMAP, shadow, rules, biography, antilibrary, health, errors, extract. Two-speed ingest worker (deep_queue + _worker_loop). PID lock. Watchdog. 2014 lines. | New scan endpoint layer + Review Hub endpoints. Worker loop redesigned for adaptive scan. | REDESIGN |
| `pipeline.py` | Nightly batch: FLRS decay → FAISS kNN graph + Leiden clustering → incremental NN fallback → conformal prediction → proposal generation. Hungarian UUID matching. SNF/Louvain legacy code still present (snf import with fallback). 1580 lines. | Adaptive scan replaces batch pipeline. Rough grouping via embeddings replaces SNF+Louvain. Proposals replaced by group-level hub staging. | REDESIGN |
| `ingest.py` | Text extraction (PDF via pdfminer+PyMuPDF fallback, DOCX, plain text). Greek detection. Spotlight metadata (kMDItemUseCount, kMDItemWhereFroms). NER via spaCy en_core_web_sm. build_embed_text. 301 lines. | Same role in new system. Needs OCR via ocrmac, markitdown for additional formats, xxhash for fast dedup gate. | EXTEND |
| `db.py` | SQLite/SQLCipher schema: files, cluster_identity, ner_entities, behavioral_edges_current, proposals, undo_log, cp_calibration, file_biography. upsert_file (inode+mtime dedup). WAL mode. ~456 lines shown; many more helpers inferred from call sites in app.py. | New tables: review_groups, wal_intents, file_states, activity_log. Current proposals table replaced by group-based staging. | EXTEND |
| `embeddings.py` | all-MiniLM-L6-v2 via sentence-transformers. FAISS IndexIDMap2 + IndexFlatIP. id_map / rev_map dicts. Persist every 10 upserts + flush on shutdown. Thread-safe with _index_lock and _embed_sem(2). 290 lines. | Same role. Model stays. Index management unchanged. unisim added for near-dedup (SimHash). | EXTEND |

## Section 3: Database Migration

### Current tables (from db.py _create_schema)

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `files` | Core file registry: id, path, inode, device_id, sha256, mtime, size_bytes, indexed_at, cluster_uuid, ingest_status, flrs_base, flrs_last_active, flrs_score, filename_date, source_domain |
| `cluster_identity` | Stable cluster UUIDs: uuid, current_cluster_id, label, created_at, last_matched_jaccard, top_keywords, file_types, file_count, last_active, lifecycle, accepted_moves, rejected_moves, gravity |
| `ner_entities` | Extracted NER: file_id, entity_text, entity_type, source |
| `behavioral_edges_current` | Co-access edges: file_id_a, file_id_b, co_access_count, last_session |
| `proposals` | Per-file move proposals: id, file_id, proposed_path, rationale, prediction_set, coverage, confidence_tier, status, signals, fingerprint, created_at, decided_at |
| `undo_log` | Move undo: id, proposal_id, original_path, executed_path, executed_at, undone_at |
| `cp_calibration` | Conformal prediction scores: cluster_uuid, file_id, nonconformity, added_at |
| `file_biography` | Per-file event log: id, file_id, event_type, payload, recorded_at |
| `rules` | User-defined routing rules: id, name, condition, destination, enabled, created_at, hit_count |

### Schema additions needed

```sql
-- File state machine (replaces ingest_status + proposal status combo)
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN file_state TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'queued'
    CHECK (file_state IN (
        'queued','hashing','duplicate_gate','embedding',
        'staged','committed','failed_read','locked','ignored'
    ));

ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN simhash INTEGER;        -- 64-bit SimHash for near-dedup
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN content_hash TEXT;      -- xxhash for fast exact dedup
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN hub_path TEXT;          -- current path in Review Hub (if staged)
ALTER TABLE files ADD COLUMN original_path TEXT;     -- path before any staging

-- Write-Ahead Log for safe move operations
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS wal_intents (
    id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    file_id      TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES files(id),
    src_path     TEXT NOT NULL,
    dst_path     TEXT NOT NULL,
    operation    TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (operation IN ('stage','commit','restore')),
    status       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
                 CHECK (status IN ('pending','complete','failed')),
    created_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
    completed_at TEXT
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_wal_pending ON wal_intents(status) WHERE status='pending';

-- Review Hub groups (replaces proposals)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS review_groups (
    id           TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    label        TEXT NOT NULL,
    status       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'staged'
                 CHECK (status IN ('staged','committed','restored','split')),
    hub_dir      TEXT,           -- physical folder in Review Hub
    created_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
    committed_at TEXT,
    split_from   TEXT REFERENCES review_groups(id)
);

-- Group membership (many files per group)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS review_group_members (
    group_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES review_groups(id),
    file_id  TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES files(id),
    PRIMARY KEY (group_id, file_id)
);

-- Activity / event log (replaces undo_log + biography for UI purposes)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS activity_log (
    id          TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type  TEXT NOT NULL,  -- 'staged','committed','restored','renamed','split','undo'
    group_id    TEXT REFERENCES review_groups(id),
    file_id     TEXT REFERENCES files(id),
    payload     TEXT,           -- JSON
    recorded_at TEXT NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_activity_time ON activity_log(recorded_at DESC);

-- FTS5 virtual table for full-text search (replaces LIKE fallback)
CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS files_fts USING fts5(
    file_id UNINDEXED,
    filename,
    content_text,
    nfc_text,
    greeklish_text,
    tokenize = 'unicode61'
);
```

### Tables to keep unchanged
`cluster_identity`, `ner_entities`, `behavioral_edges_current`, `cp_calibration`, `file_biography`, `rules`

### Tables to deprecate (keep for reference during transition)
`proposals`, `undo_log` — keep read-only; new code writes to `review_groups` + `wal_intents` + `activity_log`

### New tables from R13/R14/TECH (not in original plan)

```sql
-- Sparse candidate graph (R14) — top-K semantic neighbors per file
CREATE TABLE candidate_graph (
    file_id     INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES files(file_id),
    neighbor_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES files(file_id),
    similarity  REAL    NOT NULL,
    edge_type   TEXT    NOT NULL, -- 'same_context' / 'cross_context' / 'near_duplicate'
    computed_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (file_id, neighbor_id)
);
CREATE INDEX idx_candidate_graph_neighbor ON candidate_graph (neighbor_id);
-- Scale note: MVP = 30k files × K=10 = ~300k rows (trivial).
-- At 1M files × K=20 = ~20M rows (~1GB) — benchmark before adopting (R14 §4.1).
```

The `processing_queue` table in `TECH_engineering_foundation.md` already includes
`passport_json`, `tier_target`, `attempts`, `next_attempt_at`, and all R13 status values
(`paused_thermal`, `paused_retry`). No additional changes needed there.

### R3 Tier ↔ Passport Layer canonical mapping

R3 uses "Tier 0–3" for extraction depth. The passport system uses "Layer 1–3" for completeness. These are different axes: Tier = how deep we read; Layer = what we know.

| R3 Tier | Passport operation_type(s) | Completeness gain |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 0 (free signals — stat, xattr, mdls) | `tier0_scan` | Layer 1 |
| Tier 1 (header read — magic bytes, PDF quick info) | `tier1_extract_text`, `tier1_extract_headers` | Layer 2 |
| Tier 2 (content extraction — OCR, full text) | `ocr_single_page`, `ocr_full_document` | Layer 2 |
| Tier 3 (embedding — `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) | `embed_file`, `embed_batch_idle` | Layer 3 |

---

## Section 4: Swift UI Changes

### Current sections (16)
Dashboard, Inbox, Review, ScanProgress, Duplicates, Organized, Search, Extract, History, Rules, Settings, Antilibrary, FileMap, Projects, Shadow, Repair

### Target sections (6)
**Home | Review Hub | Organized | Search | Activity | Settings**

### Mapping

| Old section | New section | Change |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard | Home | Redesign: scan trigger, hub badge, quick stats |
| Inbox | Home | Absorbed into Home quick-view |
| Review | Review Hub | Full redesign: group cards, 5 actions per group |
| ScanProgress | Home (inline) or slide-out | Rewire to GET /scan/status file-state breakdown |
| Duplicates | Review Hub (sub-view) | Duplicate groups shown as flagged cards in hub |
| Organized | Organized | Keep ClusterWorkspace; show committed groups |
| Search | Search | Wire to new FTS5 + vector search |
| Extract | Settings (debug panel) | Move to Settings; not a primary user section |
| History | Activity | Replace undo_log with activity_log; paginated |
| Rules | Settings | Move to Settings sub-section |
| Settings | Settings | Keep, add hub folder display |
| Antilibrary | Deprecated | Remove from sidebar; accessible via Organized filter |
| FileMap | Organized (tab) | Embed as tab in Organized section |
| Projects | Organized (tab) | Embed as tab in Organized section |
| Shadow | Deprecated | Remove; Review Hub covers this use case |
| Repair | Settings | Absorb into Settings health panel |

### Key Swift changes required

1. **CuratorSection enum** — reduce from 16 to 6 cases.
2. **CuratorStore** — add `reviewGroups: [ReviewGroup]`, `scanFileStates: ScanStatus`, `activityLog: [ActivityEvent]`. Remove `proposals`, `duplicateGroups`, `inboxData`, `shadowMoves`, `historyEntries` (replace with `activityLog`).
3. **ReviewHubWorkspace** (new file) — group card list, approve/rename/commit/restore/split actions, physical hub folder path display, per-file inspector panel.
4. **HomeWorkspace** (replaces DashboardWorkspace) — scan trigger button, hub pending badge, quick stats (files scanned, groups staged, committed today).
5. **SidecarClient.swift** — add 11 new endpoint methods listed in Section 2.
6. **Models.swift** — add `ReviewGroup`, `ReviewGroupMember`, `ScanStatus`, `WALIntent` structs. FileProposal model can be removed after migration.

## Section 5: Requirements Diff

### Current requirements_prod.txt
```
fastapi, uvicorn[standard], pydantic, sentence-transformers, faiss-cpu, numpy,
spacy, snfpy, igraph, leidenalg, python-igraph, scikit-learn, scipy, crepes,
pulearn, ruptures, pdfminer.six, python-docx, python-magic, dateparser,
rapidfuzz, sqlcipher3
```

### Remove
- `snfpy` — replaced by sparse_snf.py (custom sparse implementation already present in pipeline.py comments); SNF+Louvain path is dead code in new architecture

### Add
```
river==0.25.0          # online learning for adaptive scan priority model
ocrmac>=1.0.1          # native macOS OCR for scanned PDFs (replaces no-OCR gap)
markitdown>=0.1.6      # Office/web document → markdown text extraction
send2trash>=2.1.0      # safe delete via macOS Trash (never os.unlink in new code)
unisim==1.0.1          # SimHash near-duplicate detection (64-bit hash, Hamming distance)
moondream>=1.2.2        # local vision model for image captioning (optional, lazy-loaded)
xxhash>=3.4.0          # fast 64-bit content hash for exact duplicate gate (10x faster than SHA-256 for dedup)
```

### Keep unchanged (justified)
- `sentence-transformers` + `faiss-cpu` — embedding backbone stays
- `igraph` + `leidenalg` — rough grouping via Leiden still used in new pipeline
- `spacy` — NER still needed for cluster label inference
- `pdfminer.six` + PyMuPDF (via fitz, add explicitly) — PDF extraction chain
- `rapidfuzz` — filename similarity in duplicate detection
- `sqlcipher3` — encrypted DB stays
- `crepes` + `pulearn` + `scikit-learn` — conformal prediction and PU learning kept

## Section 6: Migration Strategy

### Recommendation: Branch + incremental replacement with a compatibility shim

**Rationale based on the codebase:**

The current app.py is 2014 lines with 30+ endpoints tightly coupled to the `proposals` table and per-file approval flow. The pipeline.py Louvain/SNF code (complete with sklearn compatibility patch at the top) is a known performance bottleneck that is already partially replaced (graph_cluster.py + Leiden). The Swift CuratorStore is 1347 lines with `proposals: [FileProposal]` woven into every workspace.

A full branch rewrite is appropriate here because:

1. The data model changes are breaking: `proposals` → `review_groups` + `wal_intents`. These cannot coexist cleanly with the old approval endpoints without a proxy layer.
2. The sidebar navigation changes from 16 sections to 6. This is a root-level change in ContentView and Models.swift that cascades everywhere.
3. The pipeline run model changes fundamentally: poll-based nightly batch → streaming adaptive scan with per-file state. The current `/pipeline/run` + `/pipeline/status` loop in Models.swift must be replaced entirely.

**Recommended approach:**

1. Create branch `feature/new-architecture` from main.
2. Add new endpoints (`/scan/*`, `/review_hub/*`, `/activity`, `/undo`) to app.py alongside old endpoints. Keep old endpoints alive behind a feature flag (`CURATOR_LEGACY_API=1`).
3. Add new DB tables via migration guards (ALTER TABLE IF NOT EXISTS pattern already established in db.py). Old tables remain read-only.
4. Build new Swift workspaces (HomeWorkspace, ReviewHubWorkspace, ActivityWorkspace) as new files alongside old ones.
5. Switch CuratorSection enum to 6 cases once all new workspaces pass manual testing.
6. After two-week soak on branch, remove old endpoints and deprecated Swift files.

This preserves the existing 30k-file ingested state (FAISS index + SQLite DB) and avoids a fresh scan.

---

## Section 7: Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| WAL crash leaves files in hub with no DB record (orphan) | Medium | High — user sees phantom files | Recovery scan on startup: scan hub folder, match by SHA-256, re-create WAL record or restore to original path |
| SimHash false positive marks unique file as near-duplicate | Low-Medium | Medium — user loses access to file via hub confusion | Hamming distance threshold 5 is conservative; show both files side-by-side in UI before any action; never auto-delete |
| ocrmac + markitdown add 2-3s latency per file | High | Low — scan speed degrades | Lazy extraction: run in background worker after hash+embed; do not block staging |
| FTS5 table out of sync with files table | Low | Low — search misses | Rebuild trigger on init_db(); incremental INSERT after each embed |
| FAISS index and new file_state column diverge | Medium | Medium — re-scan needed | Startup sync_faiss_with_db() already exists; extend to also sync file_state |
| CuratorSection reduction breaks any persisted @AppStorage selection | Low | Low — UX glitch on upgrade | Add migration: if stored selection not in new enum, reset to .home |
| moondream model (vision captioning) is 2GB download | Medium | Medium — first-run stall | Lazy load behind `CURATOR_VISION=1` env var; not enabled by default |
| snfpy removal breaks import in pipeline.py for users with old venv | High | Low — only affects legacy path | try/except import already present (`_SNF_AVAILABLE` flag); pipeline.py never calls SNF in new architecture |
| send2trash unavailable on some macOS CI runners | Low | Low — test failures only | Fall back to os.unlink in test environment with explicit override |
| SQLCipher key rotation during migration | Low | High — DB corruption | Never migrate key and schema simultaneously; use separate migration steps |

---

## Section 8: New Modules (R11–R14 + TECH Passports)

These three modules did not exist in the original architecture. They must be created as new files in `engine/curator_sidecar/`. They are not extensions of existing files — they are new responsibilities.

### 8.1 `passports.py` — Operation Passport Registry + PassportGate

**New file:** `engine/curator_sidecar/passports.py`

**What it contains:**
- `CostTier` enum (`trivial` / `cheap` / `moderate` / `expensive`)
- `ThermalFloor` enum (`any` / `attentive` / `calm` / `idle`)
- `OperationPassport` dataclass (12 fields — see `TECH_operation_passports_compute_budget.md`)
- `PASSPORT_REGISTRY: dict[str, OperationPassport]` — canonical registry of all operation types
- `passport_gate(passport, thermal, system) → GateDecision` — pre-flight admission check
- `SystemSnapshot` dataclass — cached system state (thermal, battery, idle, RAM)
- `GateDecision` enum (`allow` / `defer` / `reject`)

**Integration points:**
- Called by `db.py` `enqueue_job()` — validates passport at enqueue time
- Called by processing queue worker loop before every dequeue — gate check
- Reads from `ThermalGovernor` (R11) for current thermal state
- Writes `completeness_gain` result back to `files.tier_reached` on job completion

**Build phase:** Layer 0 (must exist before any queue operations)

**Test requirement:** Every entry in `PASSPORT_REGISTRY` must have a unit test confirming `is_valid()` passes and that the gate correctly defers/allows under simulated thermal/battery conditions.

---

### 8.2 `thermal.py` — Thermal Governor + SystemSnapshot

**New file:** `engine/curator_sidecar/thermal.py`

**What it contains:**
- `ThermalState` enum (`calm` / `attentive` / `reduced` / `paused` / `asleep`)
- `ThermalGovernor` class:
  - `current_state() → ThermalState` — polls NSProcessInfo + CPU load + battery
  - `allowed_workers(tier: int) → int` — max concurrent workers given state
  - `should_pause_tier(tier: int) → bool`
  - `register_callback(fn)` — notify subscribers on state change
- `SystemSnapshot` construction logic — refreshed every 30s

**macOS integration:**
- `NSProcessInfo.thermalState` via `pyobjc-framework-Foundation`
- `psutil.cpu_percent(interval=1)` for CPU load supplement
- `psutil.sensors_battery()` for AC/battery detection
- `os.nice(15)` called at module import for the sidecar process

**Important:** On Apple Silicon, `thermalState == fair` covers a wide range. `ThermalGovernor` must treat `fair + cpu_percent > 60%` as equivalent to `reduced`, not `attentive`. This is documented in R11 §3.2.

**Build phase:** Layer 0 (required by `passports.py`)

**Test requirement:** Unit tests with mocked `NSProcessInfo` and `psutil` responses. Verify that `fair + high CPU` → `reduced` state.

### 8.3 `vector_index.py` — VectorIndex Abstraction

**New file:** `engine/curator_sidecar/vector_index.py`

**What it contains:**
- `VectorIndex` Protocol (interface) — see R11 §4.1:
  - `add(file_id, vector)`
  - `delete(file_id)`
  - `search(query, k, allowlist, blocklist) → list[tuple[int, float]]`
  - `save(path)` / `load(path)`
  - `count() → int`
- `UsearchVectorIndex` — default implementation backed by `usearch`
- `NumpyFallbackIndex` — brute-force numpy fallback for small corpora (< 5k vectors) and test environments
- `get_vector_index(config) → VectorIndex` — factory function, selects backend from `CURATOR_VECTOR_BACKEND` env var

**Why this must exist before embeddings work:**
The existing `embeddings.py` uses FAISS `IndexIDMap2` directly. This must be replaced with `VectorIndex` calls — `embeddings.py` must not know which backend is running. Without this abstraction, adding TurboVec or any other backend later requires modifying `embeddings.py` internals.

**Relationship to `embeddings.py`:** `embeddings.py` keeps the embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). `vector_index.py` keeps the index. They are separate concerns. `embeddings.py` produces vectors; `vector_index.py` stores and searches them.

**Build phase:** Layer 1 (required before Tier 2 extraction / embedding workers)

**Test requirement:** Both `UsearchVectorIndex` and `NumpyFallbackIndex` must pass the same test suite via the `VectorIndex` Protocol. Tests must verify: add → search finds it, delete → search misses it, allowlist filter works, save/load round-trips correctly.

### 8.4 Summary — New Files

| File | Build phase | Depends on | Required by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `passports.py` | Layer 0 | `thermal.py` | `db.py` (enqueue), worker loop |
| `thermal.py` | Layer 0 | `psutil`, `pyobjc` | `passports.py`, `pipeline.py` workers |
| `vector_index.py` | Layer 1 | `usearch` | `embeddings.py`, `pipeline.py` |

All three must be present and tested before any worker processes files.

### 8.5 Risk Assessment for New Modules

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pyobjc-framework-Foundation` not available in test CI | Medium | Low — thermal tests fail | Mock `NSProcessInfo` in test fixtures; CI skips thermal integration tests |
| `usearch` wheel not available for Python 3.11 arm64 | Low | High — vector index broken | Verified in `R0_package_verification.md`; `NumpyFallbackIndex` as test fallback |
| `PASSPORT_REGISTRY` missing entry for a new operation | Medium | Medium — enqueue raises at runtime | Add lint check: every `enqueue_job()` call site must reference a key in `PASSPORT_REGISTRY` |
| `passport_json` column missing from existing `processing_queue` rows (migration) | Low | Low — migration adds DEFAULT | Schema migration adds `passport_json TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'`; worker validates on dequeue |
